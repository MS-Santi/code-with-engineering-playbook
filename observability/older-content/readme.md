Building observable systems enables development teams at CSE to measure how well the application is behaving.

## Goals

1. Provide holistic view on the health of the application.
2. Help measure business performance for the customer.
3. Measure operational performance of the system.
4. Identify and diagnose failures to get to the problem fast.
